        "description": "From a young age, my fascination with Lego ignited my creativity. At the age of 4, I constructed a minion using just a few Lego pieces. My passion for building and programming with Lego grew further when my dad gifted me a Lego Classic kit, followed by a Lego Boost kit from my grandpa. With the Boost kit, I delved into programming motors and sensors, enabling me to create moving robots through block programming. To share my Lego creations with others, I even started a YouTube channel called Anirudh's Toys Review."

        "description": "My journey into advanced robotics began with the discovery of the Lego Mindstorms kit. With Mindstorms, I could build intricate robots and program them using Python with EV3Dev. This introduction to text-based programming and AI sparked my curiosity, and I've since completed over 100 projects utilizing technologies like OpenCV, TensorFlow, GPT, and Azure AI. Demonstrating my expertise, I became the youngest individual to achieve certifications in Microsoft Powerplatform and Azure AI. Additionally, I've explored no-code/low-code app development, web apps, and other technologies like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Linux."
